    "Fine-tuning means starting from a model that already knows general speech patterns (for example, wav2vec trained on thousands of hours of audio) and then slightly adjusting it on your own smaller dataset so it adapts to your task, instead of learning everything from scratch. In practice, this is done by freezing most of the pre-trained model and training only a small part (like the output layer), or by unfreezing layers gradually with a small learning rate so the model does not forget what it already knows; if you train too much or unfreeze too many layers with little data, the model will overfit and simply memorize the training examples."

During fine-tuning, these parameters can change how fast the model learns, how stable training is, and how much the model overfits. **Read the official Adam documentation** and identify which parameters can be adjusted (such as those controlling step size, regularization, and gradient smoothing), and to think about how changing them would affect training and validation curves during fine-tuning.\n",

    "A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a model that learns by looking at small pieces of data at a time and reusing the same pattern-detector everywhere, like sliding a small window along the data to spot useful patterns. A TDNN (Time-Delay Neural Network) does the same thing, but specifically for data that changes over time, such as speech: it looks at a few time steps before and after the current moment to understand what is happening now. In practice, a TDNN is simply a 1-dimensional CNN applied along the time axis, designed to recognize temporal patterns while being insensitive to small time shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-dimensional CNN (1D CNN) is a neural network that looks for patterns along a single line, not across a 2-D surface like an image. Imagine a row of numbers changing over time, such as a speech signal, sound features, or a sentence represented as numbers. A 1D CNN uses a small moving window that slides left to right along this row and checks each small chunk for patterns (for example, a short sound shape or a word pattern). The same detector is reused everywhere, so the network learns to recognize a pattern no matter where it appears in time. This makes 1D CNNs good at handling sequences like audio, where timing may shift slightly but the pattern itself stays the same."
